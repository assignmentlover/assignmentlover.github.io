* CSc 110, Spring 2017, Programming Assignment #6, Python

The Social Security Administration has published the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children born in the US for all years after 1879 (see http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/). For this project, you will prompt the user for a name and gender, and then display the name’s meaning and popularity as console text and as a graphical bar chart on a DrawingPanel. The input data about names' popularity rankings and meanings comes from two input files provided on the course web site.
